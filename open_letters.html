                    To those who will listen,

                  <p>
                    It is easy to look at what is going on between my family and The Episcopal Church and think:
                    these children are just angry because of their parents' divorce. It benefits TEC for you all
                    to believe that. It certainly benefits my father. It is convenient and easy to think like this,
                    but I challenge you to see the bigger picture. To do the hard thing, not the easy one. The
                    narrative path down which TEC has strategically led you is about divorce. About one family’s
                    divorce, and one bishop’s new marriage. But this is not a story about divorce. My personal disagreements
                    and critiques of my father’s behavior have little to do with what is appropriate behavior for a bishop. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bishop Prince Singh physically abused me on a regular basis between the ages of 3 and 13 years old.
                    Much of this abuse occurred while he was drunk because he–as he has said to us many times in writing–has
                    a drinking problem that developed into functional alcoholism. Shouldn’t this be enough to prove that
                    someone is not qualified to be a priest? The same hands Bishop Singh used to baptize hundreds of children
                    were used to physically abuse me. I wish that my father was more concerned about the effect of repeatedly
                    beating his firstborn child than his vows to the Episcopal Canons. My father’s station may have allowed
                    me a degree of financial security, but because of the violence, every professional and personal relationship
                    in my life has been fraught with trust issues, imposter syndrome, and the inseparable fusion of love and
                    physical pain.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am more than the son of a bishop. I am a musician and performing arts administrator. I am a respected
                    educator and a fierce friend. I am also a survivor of Bishop Singh’s abuse. While I wish that his vows
                    to me as a father were more important to him than his miter and robe, please understand that is not what
                    this is about. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My brother, Eklan Singh and I reported Bishop Singh’s history of domestic violence and alcohol abuse to
                    Presiding Bishop Michael Curry on December 29th, 2022 and nothing happened. Two adult domestic abuse
                    survivors (30 and 22 years old) made serious allegations of physical, emotional, and substance abuse on the
                    part of a bishop in The Episcopal Church and nothing happened. At least not until we both went public on
                    Facebook on June 14, 2023. It was not until there was a public spotlight on TEC that a formal Title IV
                    investigation was launched. To wait for 6 months to pass and for survivors to go public on Facebook to
                    launch a legitimate Title IV investigation not only proves that TEC does not take Domestic Violence allegations
                    against Bishops seriously, but also makes the entire institution's leadership complicit in our abuse. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After I disclosed this information to Presiding Bishop Curry on Dec 29th, 2022, he responded that there
                    was “no quick fix” and to await pastoral support from Bishop Todd Ousley. Bishop Todd Ousley never reached
                    out. There was a one-hour Zoom call with my mother and Presiding Bishop Curry on February 23, 2023 where
                    she addressed my father’s public messaging about our family prior to our disclosure. We did not go public
                    first. My father did that on February 24, 2021 in his email to 10,000 parishioners and clergy in the
                    Episcopal Diocese of Rochester informing them of all of his marital problems. Rev. Cameron Miller boldly
                    supported my father’s messaging by reinforcing the idea that my brother, mother, and I wanted privacy in
                    this matter. Not once did any of us ask for privacy. This was a strategy to isolate us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All I wanted was for someone–anyone–from the church to reach out with a kind or supportive word. Bishop
                    Singh got to position himself as the victim when he has in fact been my abuser for my entire life. In her
                    Zoom meeting with Presiding Bishop Curry, my mother pleaded with him to see the larger systemic problem in
                    the way my father has been granted narrative carte blanche and a TEC-sponsored megaphone to completely
                    shape the public narrative about our lives. To tell our story and place himself at the center of it. She, as
                    always, led with love and care for others–fighting to make sure other bishop families do not fall victim to
                    the same selfish abuse of power. We do not have a paid staff, team of lawyers, or a communications director.
                    Every bishop, every priest, has a private life. So what happens when that life is, in fact, very different
                    from the paid professional storytelling?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My December 29, 2022 letter to Presiding Bishop Curry clearly disclosed domestic violence, and even then I
                    could only scratch the surface. My father would administer an Adi on me regularly. Adi is the Tamil word for
                    “beating.” I received an Adi as punitive physical abuse. When my father had been drinking or was hungover,
                    this would escalate to prolonged, hard hits across my thighs, arms, legs, face, and buttocks. Reasons for
                    the physical abuse included being late for school, getting something wrong on my homework, and misbehaving
                    in church. The threatening question, Adi ventuma?! was yelled at me frequently. The English translation is,
                    “Do you want a beating?!” This was more than spanking. I remember the intensity of my heaving sobs during
                    the abuse. I found it hard to breathe, and remember gasping for air while being struck. After the abuse, I
                    would be sent to my room where I would cry myself to sleep. Sometimes I would urinate on my own carpet in
                    silent protest. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While my father was an Associate Priest at St. Peters Episcopal Church in Morristown, NJ, I tied a lamp cord
                    around my neck and pulled it as hard as I could in a suicidal attempt to escape the beatings. I was 10 years
                    old at the time. Nighttime bedwetting became an uncontrollable problem for me and would continue until I was
                    around 13 years old, when I was able to live away from the abuse at boarding school. I have teachers and friends
                    who can verify I wore diapers at night until 7th grade. Any child psychologist will tell you that this is a
                    tell-tale sign of abuse. I have been in trauma recovery therapy and EMDR sessions about the physical abuse
                    since 2018. I can provide receipts from my health insurance to verify this. When I was a child, Bishop Singh
                    was more than my father: he was my priest. When he beat me, God was beating me. This is what Bishop Singh did
                    to me when I was a child. You have been misled into thinking this is about a divorce by a power structure built
                    to protect its leaders at all costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even as an adult, my father has used his position and financial support as a way of manipulating me and forcing
                    my silence on the subject of the abuse that I have detailed above. Every time I have tried to hold him personally
                    accountable for the abuse I suffered, his first reaction has always been to threaten to resign, or to sue me
                    for defamation. I released a song on all music streaming platforms in March, 2020 under my full name. The song
                    was called “God.” These lyrics were my first public mention of the abuse. I lost a lot of theater sound design
                    work during the pandemic due to the lack of live performances. I released this song and others as a means of
                    raising funds to support myself. When my father heard the song, he called and threatened to sue me for defamation.
                    It is true that I waited until I was 30 years old to come forward publicly about the abuse in detail. Now that
                    I am an adult with more experience in the world, I realize that the circumstances of my childhood were violent
                    and unusual. I finally feel that I have broken out of Bishop Singh’s bubble of control and feel empowered and
                    safe enough to hold him accountable. Unfortunately, children of abusive parents often have no choice but to
                    normalize their experiences to survive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have nothing to gain from going public. In fact, I stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars from the
                    inheritance my father has been so quick to mention to my brother and me in recent years. The retraumatization
                    from TEC’s public messaging has caused me to have horrible nightmares about the abuse. Sleeping and eating have
                    felt like luxuries I can barely afford. My job performance has suffered (I have documentation of this), my
                    friendships have suffered, my romantic relationships have suffered. In spite of all this, I am grateful to
                    be in a place where I can finally come forward for the sake of my own long-term healing, and for other survivors.
                    I refuse to carry this deep wound around any longer. After going public on Facebook, six months of inaction
                    and 28 years of abuse were transformed into Title IV action in only six days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My father grew up in a physically abusive household himself. On her deathbed, my grandmother told me stories
                    for the first time of how my grandfather would throw things, bruising her. How he would physically discipline
                    my father and his older brother. She told me how my father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of
                    them to stop the fighting. I now know that, with her final words to me, my grandmother was finally sharing the
                    truth that my father is a hurt person. In the 30 years I have known my father, I have not once heard of any
                    kind of consistent engagement with a therapist. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As many know, victims of abuse often become abusers themselves. He threw things at all of us. I had cell phones
                    smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video game systems ripped apart. Most of the physical
                    violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day before school when he kicked me while I was on
                    the ground screaming. He was holding my crying baby brother at the time; so he could not use his hands like
                    he usually did. My father screamed at me all the time. My father screamed at my mother and brother all the time.
                    We have friends who can verify that he screamed at us in front of them. When my dad tried to give my brother
                    an Adi in the car when he was only two years old, I got between them and said, "No, not him." History repeats
                    itself. I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my father as an adult why he used physical
                    abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a "difficult kid." When I questioned him further
                    about the hypocrisy of his actions, given his profession, he said, "I didn't know better..." and "I said multiple
                    times that I am sorry for spanking you." I do not have the built-in trust that comes with being ordained, but
                    I trust that you will believe me when I say that what I experienced was more than spanking. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Presiding Bishop Curry and Bishop Ousley's actions/inactions took advantage of both our vulnerability and
                    ignorance. It is very clear from our initial letters to Presiding Bishop Curry that none of us knew anything
                    about Title IV. There is no way that either Presiding Bishop Curry or Bishop Ousley were ignorant of what they
                    were supposed to do upon receiving an explicit disclosure of physical abuse. In a time in which we were risking
                    sharing our experiences and asking for help and acknowledgment from the church that had abandoned us while my
                    father spun a false and image-managing narrative, the church responded again by failing to provide appropriate
                    care and to follow their own standards of conduct and accountability. This betrayal is worse because Presiding
                    Bishop Curry made professions of care, but did not follow the standards that he was sworn to uphold, leaving us
                    vulnerable to more harm from my father.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our understanding is that we should have received pastoral care. One Zoom call does not constitute adequate or
                    appropriate pastoral care for a family given the circumstances, especially as Presiding Bishop Curry was failing
                    in his responsibilities to treat our disclosures as grounds for a Title IV procedure led by Todd Ousley. This
                    was Ousley’s responsibility both as Bishop for the Office of Pastoral Development and as the Intake Officer
                    for Title IV offenses involving a Bishop. It has come to my attention that Bishop Todd Ousley has recused himself
                    from his role as Title IV Intake Officer since I posted about the abuse on Facebook. In February 2022, Bishop
                    Singh was appointed as Provisional bishop for two dioceses: Eastern and Western Michigan. His predecessor was
                    forced to resign after an extramarital affair. TEC’s Office of Pastoral Development, headed by Bishop Todd Ousley,
                    was heavily criticized for its response to this scandal. It seems that the Episcopal Church may have realized
                    that Ousley’s recusal was a necessary image management step.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because neither Presiding Bishop Curry nor Bishop Ousley followed proper procedure for Title IV and pastoral
                    care, my father was able to appoint a personal friend who is not a licensed therapist to oversee an unethical
                    family counseling process, in which neither of us felt safe. This "counselor," David Singh, described himself
                    as having been appointed by Presiding Bishop Curry to be a counselor for my father. We have no way of knowing
                    if this is true, but my father treated it as such. We believed that Presiding Bishop Curry had authorized David
                    Singh's plan of care, including his offering to do family counseling with my father and us. I now understand
                    that this is extremely unethical and inappropriate. We should never have been put in this position. I
                    participated in one Zoom Session with David Singh and my father which felt more like an intervention for me
                    to keep quiet than a healing process. My December 29, 2022 abuse disclosure to Presiding Bishop Curry was
                    minimized to my “abandonment issues.” Our unwillingness to continue to participate was then used by my father
                    to publicly portray himself–using church communication channels on June 19th, 2023–as having pursued therapy
                    efforts in good faith, while portraying us as unwilling to participate in a legitimate process. In this
                    communication, he disclosed confidential health information about myself and my brother without our consent. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bishop Singh is a damaged person in power with a penchant for abuse and compulsive, public lies. If you have
                    ever heard my father give a sermon, you know he is a masterful storyteller. This is a story of an organization
                    that chooses to blindly protect abusive bishops instead of their victims. This story is about someone who
                    should not be a priest, but has managed to find success within the church, along with access to increasingly
                    sophisticated public relations and legal instruments. Meanwhile, his victims have actually lost resources,
                    have become even more marginalized, and have had to go to even greater lengths to try to address the harms
                    done to us. The system has actually made it easier for Bishop Singh to get away with it as he has climbed the
                    ladder. He's not just trusted more; he has more and better people looking after him.

                    This isn't about a divorce. This isn't even directly about the abuse, in a way. This is about being victims
                    of a system in which people can get themselves elevated to power and resources regardless of their moral
                    and ethical qualifications — elevated to such power that they can even get their own families shut out and
                    disposed of like so much garbage. Even when this garbage finds the courage to speak up to power, it’s dumped
                    into rigged counseling sessions and broken promises about further contact. It's about men like Rev. Cameron
                    Miller who are paid by the church and who blatantly support powerful bishops. It’s about paid church leaders
                    who are complicit in the public lie that the Public Bishop and the Private Bishop are the same and that you
                    always get the same Godshonest person no matter what. They have the resources and the people to do this.
                    "This is The Bishop, and We Love Our Bishop."

                  <p>
                    It shatters my heart to think that the same church that molded me into the person that I am today would turn
                    around and side with my abuser. TEC has chosen to silence our voices as survivors by preying upon public
                    empathy, minimizing this as family drama, and enabling our abuser by repeatedly handing him a microphone
                    on TEC channels. Bishop Singh cannot even address the camera about this topic without hiding behind his sunglasses.

                    On paper, Title IV sounds good. If this had been offered to us after our disclosure and proper procedure
                    had been followed, it could have spared us all a great deal of pain and betrayal. TEC’s website about
                    Title IV frames the process through the lens of TEC clergy/staff, with plenty of information for the
                    accused, but very little information for reporters of abuse. Every place I have worked has had a
                    whistleblower hotline for reporting that is made explicitly clear to employees as an HR resource. Where
                    is the clear online button or phone number for victims of abuse to safely report about abuse in The
                    Episcopal Church? Who watches the watchmen? We would like for best practices to be followed now. We would
                    like reporting resources to be updated so that future survivors of bishop/clergy abuse in TEC are not left
                    to fend for themselves like we were. No one has offered to do so or offered to educate us on best practices.
                    We have had to do this ourselves and have had to ask for this ourselves. Leaving survivors in ignorance or
                    forcing them to figure everything out by themselves works in the favor of church leaders that wish to
                    evade accountability, even as the church portrays itself as holding itself to a high disciplinary standard.
                    I would love to see the church change course and do the right thing here. If survivor resources are truly
                    a priority to TEC, I would like them to show us. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Until then, if you are an Episcopalian who stands with us, I humbly ask you to stop financially donating
                    to The Episcopal Church, an organization who would rather silence abuse survivors than own their evident,
                    public mistakes. If you are asked why by your church’s leadership, I hope you will share our story. I am
                    trying to be as open as possible without making myself vulnerable to further harm and betrayal by an
                    institution that has failed our family repeatedly.

                    I could write over a thousand letters describing the horrible things my father,
                    Prince Singh has done. I would like to express my deepest resentment towards the
                    abuse and manipulation my family has had to deal with at the hands of this supposed
                    righteous man of God. Also I want my disappointment in the recent lies and betrayals
                    we have had to endure to be known.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Growing up in my household meant bearing witness to my father normalizing yelling
                    and physical violence in a family environment. The psychological trauma I suffered
                    repressed itself and only began to come out when I was in ninth grade. I suffered
                    from frequent panic attacks and depression without any knowledge of what was causing
                    it. When my father first found out I had depression he blamed me for it. I recall
                    crying in the backseat of my mother’s car in the driveway of one of our friend’s houses.
                    I told my dad I thought my friends did not care about me and nobody would care if I was
                    gone. Naturally I wanted a caring response from my father. All he could say to me was
                    “You’re friends do not care about you! They don’t care about you. The only people who
                    will be there for you are your family.” What an awful thing to say to your fourteen
                    year old son who was experiencing a pain he could not explain. I felt alienated in my
                    own house and stopped opening up to my parents about my mental health.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the time I did not realize the extent this abuse would go to. In 9th grade, I
                    heard him screaming at my mother using the word divorce. That caused me to not go
                    home from school one day and instead seek shelter at my best friend's house. More
                    and more memories began to flood my brain and I wasn’t sure if they were true. Until
                    I began to speak to my brother about our father’s alcohol abuse. Every night my dad
                    would start drinking wine as soon as he came home, sit in front of the TV until he passed
                    out on our couch till 2 or 3 am. Sometimes it was gin, other times it was whiskey. I
                    would hear him drunkenly yelling at our mother on multiple occasions. And I never did
                    anything, because this behavior was normal for me to be around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the year 2019 I had gone through many therapy sessions breaking down my relationship
                    with my father. I began to remember more about my childhood. Specifically one when I was
                    eight and sleeping in my parents’ room. My mom was in bed and my dad burst into the room
                    screaming. He was holding our landline phone in his hands and raising his voice like an angry
                    god. He then threw the phone at my mother, but it missed and hit me instead. That night I
                    heard him tell my mother that she is arrogant and that he needed to end the marriage. Later
                    I learned that my grandmother called him to complain about my mother.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was learning about my childhood through asking questions to my mom and brother, the only
                    other people who have lived in a house with him. I never risked having an argument with my
                    father about any of this. And my father had never even been open about his own homelife when
                    he was growing up in india. It was only from a sermon he had given in 2016 that I had heard
                    him talk about his father. I found out that his father used to beat his mother and left them
                    when he was eleven. I was so confused as to why I had to hear about it in a sermon in front
                    of his peers. And the second time he told me about my grandfather was in a text message in 2020.
                    In it he talked about the couple’s therapy he was doing with my mom as if it was his idea even
                    though my mom advocated for the idea of him going. He used the story of my grandad as a manipulation
                    tactic to gain sympathy from me just as he did and continues to do with his fellow religious
                    leaders. I received this text after my grandmother died. A woman whose image is totally different
                    in my mind. My father hid behind the grief of her death and used it as a shield whenever any of
                    us tried having a heart to heart with him. My father never normalized emotions and never humbled
                    himself with tears with any of us. Till date he has not looked at us and apologized for anything.
                    He would send texts saying sorry but then a few hours later there would be a nasty text or yelling.
                    Shortly after receiving this text I mentioned above, the pandemic hit. My parents and I had to
                    isolate ourselves in our house.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was the time when I had to act. I heard my mother talking to my father downstairs while I
                    was in the upstairs hallway. I listened and heard that my mom wanted my father to be understanding
                    as she tried so hard to make the marriage work. As usual my father wouldn’t listen. Instead he
                    used me as a bargaining chip. I remember him saying “Well what are we gonna tell Eklan? Because
                    for your information he is on my side.” I remember my heart sinking. He continued to say “I wrote
                    him a letter and while he didn’t respond I know what he is thinking.” The only letters I have gotten
                    from my dad are sappy Christmas cards where he keeps talking about God’s grace and that he wants
                    what’s best for me. I did not know what letter he was referring to. And then I realized he was
                    talking about the text he sent me. I was furious and refused to let him believe I was on his side
                    in any way. I wrote down every point I wanted to tell him. I wrote about how his alcoholism upset
                    me, how he is horrible to my mother and how sexist and abusive he is as an individual. I told him
                    he had to try and stop drinking and that I had caught him having a glass of gin late at night even
                    after family therapy. I told him hard alcohol was especially bad and he tried to convince me that
                    gin is not hard alcohol. Clearly he thinks I’m stupid!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I continued to try and make him understand the error of his ways in that talk. He asked me why I
                    was getting angry when in reality my voice was calm and steady. I was only saying what hurt me and
                    he wasn’t listening. Then he told me that I was to blame for letting this behavior happen. His exact
                    words to me were “You chose to stay silent for nineteen years!” I was nineteen years old when I
                    confronted him on this matter. It is no child’s choice to stay silent in their household when it
                    is being run like a dictatorship. At that point I stopped trying to be calm. I was so hurt that I
                    yelled at him louder than I have ever yelled before. Again he asked me why I was getting angry. I
                    can say now that the behavior of anger is the only thing my father has modeled authentically for me.
                    He would talk about peace, understanding and love every Sunday morning in church and then return home
                    only to practice anger, abuse and misogyny. In every event I described observing he told me it was
                    not true. For no other reason than he did not remember them. He denied the truth that I had learned
                    because he doesn’t see any abnormality in his behavior. It was only in this discussion where I had
                    discovered he had tried going to therapy. He said it didn’t work for him.I had told him what I wanted
                    from him. I wanted him to stop drinking, stop yelling, prioritize us and try therapy again. Going to
                    therapy is not the same thing as doing therapy. He stormed upstairs and shut himself in his room. Us
                    boys are still not his priority since he has spent time and energy for months (maybe years) reconnecting
                    with his old girlfriend while he has not made any sincere efforts to reconcile with his sons in a
                    humble loving way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My father never tried rebuilding a relationship with me after that. I was hoping for a loving hug
                    and a heartful humbling of himself. He came up to me the next day, stood behind me at the dining
                    table and said that he didn’t know how I had hurt him or where to start in making things better.
                    When I reiterated all the things I had mentioned the day before he scoffed, smiled and walked away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had hoped for a new leaf in him when my parents announced to me and my brother that they were
                    getting a divorce. To my dismay my eyes fall upon an email he sent out to his entire church which
                    humanizes him in the divorce and demonizes my mother. He made sure that his friends and colleagues
                    believed that the divorce was her fault when in actuality he did not want to face the facts.
                    Again I remember him screaming at my mother that he is through with her and that the marriage
                    is over on numerous occasions. Then the cycle of horrors continues. Our house burned down in
                    the summer of 2020. My mother and I had already left, but our belongings were still in the house.
                    Thankfully my father got out in time and he is the only person who received support, condolences
                    and love from the church. Specifically from members of a church we have dedicated so much of our
                    lives to. And the fact that this is all because he lied and continues to lie makes me wonder.
                    What would good Christian people do if they realized the truth? Maybe nothing, I can’t control
                    anyone’s perception. I can only write down and analyze what I have observed. I even recall him
                    watching a News Report about a girl who had been raped and he made very sexist appalling remarks
                    regarding rape desire and he was blaming the victim.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And now today my father is in India. Seeking a celebration of reconnecting with his seminary
                    sweetheart whom he could not marry because her father opposed. Then he met my mother through
                    arranged marriage knowing she is Dalit and dark. Maybe this made him “feel” good. He gave her
                    grief for those very same identities. Now, he simply couldn't wait to strengthen his reconnecting
                    and rekindling an old flame and is parading her by his side saying that God has been good to him
                    and has allowed him to move on. This is the lie he tells his “religious” friends as if my mom,
                    brother and I were such a problem. He even told me that we have mental problems. I wonder where
                    I got that from, dad? Maybe it’s because you brought your generational trauma into our house and
                    let it grow. He needs psychiatric help. He told us that each of us three are depressed and we
                    need psychological help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Prince Singh will say that my mother has turned me against him. Perhaps he does not actually
                    respect me enough to believe that I have fancy and personal experiences and am capable of advocating
                    for myself. I am sickened by the lies and lack of compassion from people who claimed to be friends
                    of mine and my family. I write all this down to do nothing but share my truth. I had to write all
                    of this down so I never forget to recognize this narcissism again. There is a lot more I can write,
                    and I will. I refuse to stay silent anymore. This is what happened. My story does not end with a lie.

                    The slogan of the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester popularized by Bishop Prince Singh,
                    the ex-husband of Roja Suganthy-Singh is “Welcoming all as God’s beloved.” The account
                    that follows makes a mockery of that motto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dear listener,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After much pain and over two years of reflection, I write as an injured woman, mother,
                    and former Bishop Spouse of The Episcopal Diocese of Rochester in the hope that recent
                    errors will not be visited on clergy and Bishop families in the future. This letter is
                    meant to call the Episcopal Church and Bishop Singh into accountability. My ex-husband
                    has attempted to control the narrative with public statements, but the world should know
                    the truth. I ask that the Episcopal Church acknowledge  the deep harm done to me and to
                    my sons by the assumption that a Bishop’s word should not be questioned, or even explored. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why did the Episcopal Church choose silence for six months even after our sons sent letters
                    to the Presiding Bishop Michael Curry in December 2022 describing our experiences of physical,
                    emotional, and psychological abuse by Bishop Singh? Why did the Episcopal Church remain silent
                    after I met with Bishop Curry via zoom on Feb 22, 2023? How can church leaders choose to be silent
                    when an entire family is reaching out about a Bishop’s abuse? Does my social identity as an
                    Indian-American Dalit woman mean that I should be isolated and ignored? 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On February 24th, 2021, the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Rochester, leaders in the
                    entire Diocese, the Presiding Bishop, the House of Bishops, clergy outside the Diocese, and
                    thousands of laypeople received a letter from Bishop Singh announcing that I had initiated the
                    end of our marriage. In so doing, the Bishop made unilateral use of his position and power to
                    intentionally preserve his image at the cost of my reputation – and the truth. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bishop Singh sent that letter after I left our home on January 23rd, 2021; I left because I did
                    not feel safe. I was the target of Bishop Singh’s repressed anger, biting tolerance, and abuse
                    for many reasons, one of which he revealed after 28 years: that  I was a Dalit. In the man-made
                    caste hierarchy in India, Bishop Singh is placed in the 4th caste called Shudra. My ancestral family
                    was shunned by Indian society as “Outcaste” (Untouchables) or Dalits. The intervention of missionaries
                    brought education and hope into my family. Bishop Singh and I worked hand in hand to deny the existence
                    of caste differences and erase those caste lines. You can imagine the deep betrayal I experienced when
                    Bishop Singh told me on April 17th 2020, “Because you are Dalit, I tolerated a lot in this marriage.”
                    He put these words in an email as well. My heart sank because this was a man with whom I joined hands in
                    creating awareness on the dangers of caste and someone who encouraged me in my self-identification as Dalit.
                    In that moment, his growing discomfort in my outspokenness on Dalit women’s issues and my emergence as
                    a prominent voice in the Anti-Caste movement in the USA became clear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since 2011, Bishop Singh has asked with increasing frequency for a divorce. He has threatened
                    that he is done with me and that I should leave the house. I have emails from him in 2020 very
                    clearly asking for a separation and for a divorce. It is a blatant lie that in his February 2021
                    letter, he points to me as the initiator of the divorce. The pattern of lies continues. One of many:
                    In Bishop Singh’s communication with the Dioceses of Michigan on June 19th 2023 he wrote, “after two
                    and half years post-divorce I moved into a new relationship.” That statement is untrue. We were divorced
                    in June 2022. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may wonder why I did not contact the Standing Committee or the Presiding Bishop at the time the
                    letter went out to the Diocese of Rochester. Contrary to Bishop Singh’s assertions in his letter, I
                    care for him, and had always hoped that one day he would truly repent to my sons and me and take
                    responsibility for his words and actions and that our marriage could be saved, and our family preserved.
                    I felt that publicly contradicting Bishop Singh at that time would have put an end to that hope.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though I was strongly opposed to sending out the letter, Bishop Singh insisted that the letter
                    had to go out soon. We had only been separated for a few weeks at that point. I was scared, in a vulnerable
                    state just after leaving my home, and finally agreed under duress to the least horrifying of several drafts.
                    It was not until the letter went out, and I heard comments from others including a Bishop spouse, that I
                    actually felt the impact and saw the deliberate attempt to hide the truth. There were untrue words that I
                    requested my ex-husband to remove; instead they stayed. I was devastated by the tone of finality in the letter
                    and was saddened that the family therapy sessions with our sons, and all my contact with Bishop Singh except
                    that of a legal nature, ended with this letter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is very easy for people to ask: why didn’t you leave sooner? The simple answer is that I love him and
                    our children. I was trapped with  financial dependence on him since I left a secure tenure-track professor
                    position in New Jersey and had to start from scratch as a part time lecturer.  A pattern of Bishop Singh’s
                    intermittent proclamations of his love for me made it harder as well. He would verbally abuse me and then
                    in the very next minute he would be very kind and loving. I was mentally tossed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The impact of Bishop Singh’s Diocesan-wide letter on February 24, 2021 is hard to overstate. Our ties
                    with the Episcopal Church were severed; priests and friends avoided me. Perhaps my Diocesan friends were
                    fearful since Bishop Singh told everyone not to contact me. Either way, I was cut adrift from my faith
                    community while my soon-to-be ex-husband retained his Bishop’s privileges. He continued to enjoy friendships,
                    dinners, drinking and kayaking trips with clergy in Rochester. Even after he left the Diocese, he has made
                    special visits to commune with priests there. Why did the Presiding Bishop make this special concession to
                    overlook Bishop Singh’s  flouting of the rule that Bishops must  sever relationships with their previous
                    Dioceses? To me, this is an indication of their close friendship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except for one couple, who care deeply for our sons, I did not receive a call or even a note from my
                    parish pastor or from any members of my parish to enquire after my well-being, much less to verify the
                    veracity of the statements in the Bishop’s letter. After twelve years of my service to this Diocese,
                    much of it heavy, hands-on work, continuous hospitality, and teaching at many other parishes where I
                    truly believed I had built friendships and community; I heard nothing from any of those church members.
                    One kind soul reached out to me after six months, explaining that the closing of the Bishop’s letter in
                    which he asked for “space” for each of us, kept her from doing it sooner.  Since I wrote to the Diocese
                    of Rochester, several people from the Diocese have told me that they were following the instructions in
                    the letter from Bishop Singh and the chair of the standing committee Cameron Miller to not contact me and
                    to respect my privacy! This was an orchestrated strategic isolation of a woman of color in a male dominated
                    institution. The impact of that sentence about “space” came as a shock to me when it was published. I needed
                    support, not silence. I was devastated that Rev. Cameron Miller’s attachment to that letter spoke for me
                    without even talking with me and took the liberty to use the term “impending divorce” which totally
                    misrepresented me and my desires. No legal paperwork had been filed at the time of this mailing. No one from
                    the standing committee talked with me. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another blow came when my sons and I were not even mentioned at the Bishop’s Farewell Party from the
                    Diocese of Rochester.  This oversight was acutely felt by our sons.  You will understand that a mother’s
                    pain for her slighted children is worse than she can possibly feel for herself. The Presiding Bishop
                    spoke at this event, lending his authority and stamp of approval to the event. This intentional act of
                    exclusion hurt because I loved this Diocese, and even more because I am a brown Dalit woman who has been
                    made invisible. I have become a nobody to the Church, except for a few kind laypeople who genuinely and
                    unconditionally reached out. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most devastatingly, I did not hear a word from the Presiding Bishop after Bishop Singh’s letter, even
                    though my sons and I had enjoyed a close pastoral and friendly relationship with him. On December 17,
                    2022, I felt strong enough to email him to ask why.  He replied that he was given to  understand that
                    I did not wish to hear from him!  That is, he believed Bishop Singh so completely, so utterly, that our
                    years of pastoral care and friendship were immediately erased. He did speak with me once over zoom on
                    February 22nd, 2023, reiterating the fact that an individual not identified by Curry told him that I did
                    not want to be contacted by him. Further, Bishop Curry stated that he asked that individual to convey to
                    me that I could call him anytime. I informed Bishop Curry that I never stated that I did not want to be
                    in contact with him. I was never informed that I could call PB Curry any time. Another lie, omission, and
                    strategic isolation. In that call I clearly stated that I left the house because I did not feel safe. I
                    mentioned the excessive use of alcohol by Bishop Singh. Further,I offered my help to provide resources
                    for other Bishop and clergy families in similar abusive situations. The Presiding Bishop stated that Bishop
                    Todd Ousley will be in touch with me, but six months passed and still no word from the PB or from Ousley
                    or his office. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Presiding Bishop and other church leaders decided to ignore 31 years of physical, verbal, and
                    emotional abuse and lies that my sons and I disclosed.  Is this what Jeus would do? It is very sad
                    that a church community that is supposed to stand with the oppressed, instead joins hands with power,
                    patriarchy and privilege to silence the truth. This is irrefutably abuse impinged on a family on the
                    part of the Episcopal Church in its negligence, dismissive attitude and refusal to hear the truth about
                    domestic abuse and pushing the facts on abuse under the rug to protect a Bishop. This spiritual abuse
                    by the church has caused my children and me emotional and psychological trauma.    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I loved the church so much that I wanted to marry a priest. Our marriage was quasi- arranged by a close
                    family friend who was Bishop Singh’s aunt. We were introduced in August, 1991 and were married two months
                    later. I was  enamored by his charisma, kindness, the fact that he said he would not take a dowry, and
                    that he stated that did not care about caste. Whether he intentionally lied or deceived himself, after
                    28 years of marriage; I realized that he had lived our entire marriage viewing me as lesser because of
                    our caste differences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The emotional abuse started quite early in our life together. Before we were married, he told me that
                    he was in love with a person while in Seminary and that her father did not approve of their marriage.
                    In his video message on Facebook on June 20th 2023 about his remarriage he says, “we dated in seminary”
                    but it was more than that. When we were married, Singh told me--full of male entitlement--that I needed
                    to be patient with him until he got over his former lover. Barely two months into our marriage he told
                    me that he was attracted to fair-skinned women! I lost all confidence and joy in that moment. Days after
                    our first son was born, he wrote to his friend, David Singh, saying that I did not have a pretty face
                    and he was struggling to love me. There was no point in our marriage at which he stated that he had moved
                    on from his former lover and that I was the only love in his life now.  She was an invisible presence in
                    our marriage, and he tried to fill that invisibility with deep emotional attachments with other visible
                    women. Charming as he is, that was easy – women and girls with ready access to him swarmed, right from
                    the very early years of our marriage. If I brought it up, he would scream at me. He keeps stating now that
                    he was faithful to me; maybe he was physically but he was not emotionally. Even his act of stating the
                    lack of “infidelity” publicly and unpromoted makes it seem untrue.  In fact, in 2014 he emailed me a picture
                    from a Bishop’s conference in Taiwan. The picture was a selfie with a woman who looked like his ex-lover.
                    He expected me to accept it as a joke! This incident pulled me down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We moved to the USA as a family with our baby, Nivedhan, in 1993. I was in the USA in 1990 doing my
                    masters in Christian Education in Virginia. I continued my studies and Bishop Singh joined a master’s
                    in theology Program. Rocky years emerged with the pattern of loving and caring followed by physical
                    and verbal abuse. He would throw  things, lift his hands in beating gestures, and even wave a knife
                    at me while with marriage counseling. His alcoholism grew worse year by year, so much so that I slowly
                    felt less desire for his company. As a family we would barely get 20 minutes of his non-alcohol self
                    each day.  It was hours and hours of drinking, watching TV and sleeping/passing out on the couch. He
                    continued to blame me for his alcohol use throughout our marriage counseling sessions because I brought
                    it up for discussion. In a June 6, 2020 email to me, Bishop Singh said, “Your psychological fragility
                    was a huge part of why I have done this work of absorbing your anxieties by just biting my tongue. And
                    my subsequent drinking.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In our home, as my sons have already stated, we were subject to several forms of abuse. I was relieved
                    when our older son Nivedhan secured admission into the American Boychoir Boarding school from 6th grade
                    till 8th grade because he was subject to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Eklan was subject
                    to a lot of anger and derogatory words as well, especially in front of his friends. If I intervened at
                    any point, Bishop Singh yelled at me.  Humiliating me with racist, derogatory words in Tamil such as,
                    “Mayiru” (pubic hair). I experienced financial abuse as well. I would periodically find out that thousands
                    of dollars were given to his family/relatives, and institutions here without consulting me.

                    Our son, Eklan, struggled with depression from the relentless emotional abuse. He was brave enough to
                    share this truth in his own open letter, which he shared with Presiding Bishop Curry on December 29, 2022.
                    Bishop Singh did not have any sympathy, but insisted that he snap out of it. When I expressed concern with
                    Bishop Singh’s lack of care and dismissiveness around his attention to other women, he would snigger and
                    mock me. He would reject me emotionally and physically at those times. This escalated behavior eventually
                    increased my anxiety level and during one of his trips to India in 2013, without even saying bye to me,
                    my therapist advised me to seek psychiatric care. Upon his return there was no sympathy. “I don’t want to
                    talk about this and ruin our reunion…Don’t expect that you will now be the center of my world” These words
                    pierced through me. He would often remind me that, “Being joyful is a choice!” This is emotionally
                    unintelligent, offensive, and stigmatizes the realities of mental health.

                    Eventually, the years of abuse and use of alcohol became too much to bear . On January 23, 2021--I left
                    our family home because I feared for my physical safety. Bishop Singh’s response shows that I was right
                    to be concerned. My sons and I have faced isolation, public slander, unethical disclosures of private
                    medical information, and personal heartbreak. The Church was my home since I was born and now I have lost
                    my home. My sons have lost their home. I have lost trust in the church, and its leaders.

                    To the priests and leaders in the Episcopal Church who stand for truth, please act on your belief.
                    You preach that God seeks out the vulnerable and rejects the people in power. I ask you to follow Christ’s
                    example and believe survivors of abuse when we share our stories. Aren’t we a part of “God’s beloved” as well?
