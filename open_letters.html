                    To those who will listen,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am about to be very open with you about some painful details regarding my family and the
                    ways in which we suffered under my father. Please be advised, this is an account of domestic
                    abuse. This past July, my parents' divorce papers were finalized. Rewinding: In February of
                    2021, my father sent a letter to every bishop, priest, leader, and parishioner in the Episcopal
                    Diocese of Rochester stating that after thoughtful, mutual work: my parents chose to end their
                    marriage as a team. In fact, he actually went as far as to say that my mother is the one who left.
                    This is a lie. My dad left us. He left us after years of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and
                    alcoholism. He has used the word divorce on my mother several times in the past 5 - 6 years.
                    The following are excerpts from the Rt. Rev. Prince Singh's February 2021 mailing with my
                    commentary:
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>
                    "After some intentional therapy and marriage counseling, Roja named the truth that our marriage is over."
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>
                    In September 2019 my father told my mother that she needs to go, leave, and live her life
                    because she had become too confident and independent. She had just come back from taking my
                    brother to Venice which was his high school graduation present. She wanted to make that happen
                    for him which my father was not interested in because he wanted to spend his sabbatical in Kerala, India.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, my grandmother was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2019. Her health began rapidly
                    declining, and she passed away in January of 2020. This loss, combined with my father's stress in
                    leading the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester through a pandemic; led to what I observed as
                    another major turning point in my parents' marriage. Marriage counseling and personal therapy
                    was suggested by my mother, but my father refused for years. At this point, she did finally
                    convince him to go. However, this was after decades of a cycle of emotional abuse, alcoholism,
                    physical abuse (towards me), occasionally throwing things at or by my mother, and a pattern of
                    gaslighting that we grew all too familiar with growing up in the Singh household. My
                    grandmother had just died. He was grieving. He was reacting, but he was not intentionally
                    seeking out grief therapy when my mother asked him to get help with grief counseling before
                    going for marriage counseling, he refused. They started marriage counseling in February 2020.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>
                    "Both of us did our best to work through things, and I was genuinely hopeful. Together, we
                    grieve the end of a shared dream, each in our way. Please know that we are not taking this
                    step due to hostility, resentment, abuse, or infidelity."
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>
                    My father grew up in a physically abusive household. I heard stories of how my grandfather
                    would throw things at my grandmother, bruising her. My father, at the age of 11, would get
                    between the two of them to stop the fighting. As many know, victims of abuse often become
                    perpetrators themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My father hit me often as a form of punishment growing up. He threw things at us. I had cell
                    phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video game systems ripped
                    apart. Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day
                    before school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain because he was
                    holding my crying baby brother at the time; so he could not use his hands. I was screamed at
                    often. My mother was yelled at often. When my dad tried to spank my baby brother for the first
                    time, I got between them and said,
                    "No, not him." I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my father (as an adult)
                    why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a "difficult
                    kid."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester elected my dad to be bishop, we knew we had no
                    choice in the matter. We were moving. From the home and community that we had spent almost
                    a decade building in New Jersey. It didn't matter that my mom had an established career as a
                    tenure track professor and friendships in Franklin Lakes, we were moving; and that was that. He
                    chose the advancement of his career and image over the needs of his family.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The new job introduced new stresses into my dad's life and a lot of travel being on various
                    committees. So continued the cycle of drinking and absentee parenting, under which my brother
                    would suffer the most. Every day my dad would get home from work, whether 4 pm or 9 pm he
                    would sit in front of the television for 5-6 hours consuming bottles upon bottles of wine, with
                    scotch and whiskey to cap off the night. (I knew I couldn't talk to my father when he got like
                    this, as it always ended in him yelling.) All the while, there would be little to no interaction with
                    my mother. Between this and my father's travel, the expectations on my mother to entertain the
                    numerous events and dinner parties that come with being the wife of the Bishop sky rocketed.
                    My mother orchestrated and implemented fundraising of Dalit girl children's education without
                    much help from my father. There is no "Bish-chef" (a popular nickname for my dad) without the
                    uncredited work and support of my mom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there was no physical infidelity that we know of, we know that he has a history of flirting
                    with other women. Based on our observations, we believe that he has had extramarital deep
                    emotional affairs with several women including a member of his staff.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>
                    "Our attention and concern going forward will be out of deep respect for each other and care for
                    Nived[han] and Eklan, who will remain our shared treasure, hope, and joy."
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>
                    I have seen the first draft of this letter. It didn't include my brother or me. That was added later.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the marriage counseling process, I begged my dad to pursue personal grief
                    counseling for the loss of his mother. Instead, he made a mission out of arranging the marriage of
                    my cousin, Nishanthan Singh, in India. In less than three days and he did not like it when we
                    expressed our disproval. Yes, you read that correctly: my father arranged a marriage. The full-on
                    stereotypical, archaic, caste-based, misogynistic practice of arranged marriage. He spent months
                    going back and forth to India making sure that his family there was taken care of. All the while,
                    his wife and children in the USA awaited his return so that we could start the family counseling
                    that we had finally convinced him to do.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In this divorce process there has been no respect shown towards my mother, my brother or me
                    but instead, he chose to slander her name by convincing the world that he is the victim and that
                    my mother walked out on him when it was him who used the word divorce and other words to
                    ask her to leave the house for over ten years, but more intensely the past five years. The yelling
                    and anger still continues as I experienced it during my Thanksgiving visit with him in 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>
                    "I have personally informed the Presiding Bishop, the Bishop for Pastoral Development,
                    our Standing Committee, and many leaders about our decision. We have their prayers,
                    blessing, and support as we proceed in this direction."
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>
                    This is just untrue. Specifically, the "We" have their prayers. Our family gave so much to the
                    Episcopal Diocese of Rochester; to the Episcopal Church as a whole. My mother, brother and I
                    left behind a community of friends. My mom left a job as well. I performed at many church
                    events with my bands, Eklan and I both were active in youth group events. We went to every
                    General Convention where we volunteered extensively. I even worked the front desk at diocese
                    office for months after I graduated college. None of this measures up to the daily work of my
                    mother to support my dad's lifestyle and work. Bearing all of this in mind, I would like to point
                    out that not one person from the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester has said a word to my brother,
                    me, or my mother since my father sent this letter. Like so many of my father's communications,
                    this letter is an attempt to steer the narrative. He makes it seem as though, just because my mom
                    stated that she couldn't take it anymore, he makes it seem that he is the victim. Like many times
                    before, on April 22, 2022 he looked at my mother and said we should get a divorce but my
                    mother told him that she wanted to continue working on the marriage and since my father had
                    discontinued marriage counseling, she continued marriage counseling by herself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Diocese and a faith that teaches us to love and support each other unconditionally has
                    completely sided with the male perspective here. Not once was my mother thanked for her
                    service to the community in Rochester. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said nothing to my
                    mother, my brother, or myself until we reached out ourselves in December 2022. Many people in
                    the church were under the impression that we did not want support, that we wanted privacy. This
                    was a strategy to isolate us. I want to be perfectly clear on this point: not once did my mother,
                    brother, or myself ask for privacy in this matter. If there was any messaging around respecting
                    our privacy and cutting us off from the support of the church, it was generated by someone else.
                    My father said that we are the ones who left, when in reality: we were forced out due to his
                    alcohol consumption, workplace flirtations, and anger issues. No one asked for our truth. We
                    weren't given a voice.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>
                    "I will continue to serve as your bishop and intend to take some time off as soon as possible for
                    self-care, lament, reflection, and prayer. I wish Roja only the best in her future. I am heartbroken
                    but believe we will be okay by the grace of God. We are genuinely sorry to share such news,
                    especially while we are in a global pandemic. I do so with the desire to be transparent."
                  </strong></p>
                  <p>
                    First, in my opinion he has not done any reflection but merely three weeks after the divorce was
                    finalized, called me to ask my permission to date! There is no transparency because he has not
                    stated in the letter that in the past six years he has very often told my mother that this marriage is
                    over and has asked her to leave. Second, why did this need to be public knowledge? Why does
                    an entire faith community need to know about this very private matter? Despite my dad's first
                    name, we are not royalty.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There was a family friend's wedding soon after this letter went out. Some life-long friends that
                    went to seminary with my dad back in India. I wanted to be there to support my friend, but how
                    could I? How could I show my face knowing that all anyone there was going to do was stare and
                    ask questions about what was going on? Only two of my parents' friends from that wedding of
                    hundreds have spoken to my mother, after a lifetime of friendship and ministry together. Aren't
                    we supposed to care for the misrepresented person, the immigrant, the mother and her children?
                    Isn't the question most Christians ask "What would Jesus do?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I hate that my father wrote this letter. I hate even more that he felt that he needed to. That what
                    only needed to be a programmatic update became the misogynistic shunning that it was. It makes
                    me sick that you all know some stylized, one-sided version of my family's private business. On
                    top of it, no one from the church ever even bothered to pick up the phone and ask me how I was
                    doing. To sit there at my father's farewell Zoom Service and see the complete redaction of my
                    mother's face. To see us "cropped-out" as though we never existed. He leads in dialogues about
                    the Doctrine of discovery that erased Native Americans but has managed to erase us from the
                    history of the Diocese of Rochester.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Considering all the above, it has indirectly come to my attention that my father has started a new
                    relationship with a prior deep love interest in India during his seminary days and is having
                    celebrations already. This further reinforces that healing his relationship with me or my brother
                    is not a priority and he would rather clear his name under the guise of "God's plan" and jump into
                    a new marriage to uphold his name in the eyes of the church.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What has happened in my family is far from amicable, anything to the contrary is a bold-faced
                    lie. I'm disappointed in the Episcopal church. I'm disappointed in my father. I'm disappointed in
                    myself for remaining silent on this subject for so long. I have shared my truth, what you choose
                    to do with it is up to you.

                    The slogan of the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester popularized by Bishop Prince Singh,
                    the ex-husband of Roja Suganthy-Singh is “Welcoming all as God’s beloved.” The account
                    that follows makes a mockery of that motto.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dear listener,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After much pain and over two years of reflection, I write as an injured woman, mother,
                    and former Bishop Spouse of The Episcopal Diocese of Rochester in the hope that recent
                    errors will not be visited on clergy and Bishop families in the future. This letter is
                    meant to call the Episcopal Church and Bishop Singh into accountability. My ex-husband
                    has attempted to control the narrative with public statements, but the world should know
                    the truth. I ask that the Episcopal Church acknowledge  the deep harm done to me and to
                    my sons by the assumption that a Bishop’s word should not be questioned, or even explored. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Why did the Episcopal Church choose silence for six months even after our sons sent letters
                    to the Presiding Bishop Michael Curry in December 2022 describing our experiences of physical,
                    emotional, and psychological abuse by Bishop Singh? Why did the Episcopal Church remain silent
                    after I met with Bishop Curry via zoom on Feb 22, 2023? How can church leaders choose to be silent
                    when an entire family is reaching out about a Bishop’s abuse? Does my social identity as an
                    Indian-American Dalit woman mean that I should be isolated and ignored? 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On February 24th, 2021, the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Rochester, leaders in the
                    entire Diocese, the Presiding Bishop, the House of Bishops, clergy outside the Diocese, and
                    thousands of laypeople received a letter from Bishop Singh announcing that I had initiated the
                    end of our marriage. In so doing, the Bishop made unilateral use of his position and power to
                    intentionally preserve his image at the cost of my reputation – and the truth. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Bishop Singh sent that letter after I left our home on January 23rd, 2021; I left because I did
                    not feel safe. I was the target of Bishop Singh’s repressed anger, biting tolerance, and abuse
                    for many reasons, one of which he revealed after 28 years: that  I was a Dalit. In the man-made
                    caste hierarchy in India, Bishop Singh is placed in the 4th caste called Shudra. My ancestral family
                    was shunned by Indian society as “Outcaste” (Untouchables) or Dalits. The intervention of missionaries
                    brought education and hope into my family. Bishop Singh and I worked hand in hand to deny the existence
                    of caste differences and erase those caste lines. You can imagine the deep betrayal I experienced when
                    Bishop Singh told me on April 17th 2020, “Because you are Dalit, I tolerated a lot in this marriage.”
                    He put these words in an email as well. My heart sank because this was a man with whom I joined hands in
                    creating awareness on the dangers of caste and someone who encouraged me in my self-identification as Dalit.
                    In that moment, his growing discomfort in my outspokenness on Dalit women’s issues and my emergence as
                    a prominent voice in the Anti-Caste movement in the USA became clear.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since 2011, Bishop Singh has asked with increasing frequency for a divorce. He has threatened
                    that he is done with me and that I should leave the house. I have emails from him in 2020 very
                    clearly asking for a separation and for a divorce. It is a blatant lie that in his February 2021
                    letter, he points to me as the initiator of the divorce. The pattern of lies continues. One of many:
                    In Bishop Singh’s communication with the Dioceses of Michigan on June 19th 2023 he wrote, “after two
                    and half years post-divorce I moved into a new relationship.” That statement is untrue. We were divorced
                    in June 2022. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may wonder why I did not contact the Standing Committee or the Presiding Bishop at the time the
                    letter went out to the Diocese of Rochester. Contrary to Bishop Singh’s assertions in his letter, I
                    care for him, and had always hoped that one day he would truly repent to my sons and me and take
                    responsibility for his words and actions and that our marriage could be saved, and our family preserved.
                    I felt that publicly contradicting Bishop Singh at that time would have put an end to that hope.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even though I was strongly opposed to sending out the letter, Bishop Singh insisted that the letter
                    had to go out soon. We had only been separated for a few weeks at that point. I was scared, in a vulnerable
                    state just after leaving my home, and finally agreed under duress to the least horrifying of several drafts.
                    It was not until the letter went out, and I heard comments from others including a Bishop spouse, that I
                    actually felt the impact and saw the deliberate attempt to hide the truth. There were untrue words that I
                    requested my ex-husband to remove; instead they stayed. I was devastated by the tone of finality in the letter
                    and was saddened that the family therapy sessions with our sons, and all my contact with Bishop Singh except
                    that of a legal nature, ended with this letter.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is very easy for people to ask: why didn’t you leave sooner? The simple answer is that I love him and
                    our children. I was trapped with  financial dependence on him since I left a secure tenure-track professor
                    position in New Jersey and had to start from scratch as a part time lecturer.  A pattern of Bishop Singh’s
                    intermittent proclamations of his love for me made it harder as well. He would verbally abuse me and then
                    in the very next minute he would be very kind and loving. I was mentally tossed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The impact of Bishop Singh’s Diocesan-wide letter on February 24, 2021 is hard to overstate. Our ties
                    with the Episcopal Church were severed; priests and friends avoided me. Perhaps my Diocesan friends were
                    fearful since Bishop Singh told everyone not to contact me. Either way, I was cut adrift from my faith
                    community while my soon-to-be ex-husband retained his Bishop’s privileges. He continued to enjoy friendships,
                    dinners, drinking and kayaking trips with clergy in Rochester. Even after he left the Diocese, he has made
                    special visits to commune with priests there. Why did the Presiding Bishop make this special concession to
                    overlook Bishop Singh’s  flouting of the rule that Bishops must  sever relationships with their previous
                    Dioceses? To me, this is an indication of their close friendship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Except for one couple, who care deeply for our sons, I did not receive a call or even a note from my
                    parish pastor or from any members of my parish to enquire after my well-being, much less to verify the
                    veracity of the statements in the Bishop’s letter. After twelve years of my service to this Diocese,
                    much of it heavy, hands-on work, continuous hospitality, and teaching at many other parishes where I
                    truly believed I had built friendships and community; I heard nothing from any of those church members.
                    One kind soul reached out to me after six months, explaining that the closing of the Bishop’s letter in
                    which he asked for “space” for each of us, kept her from doing it sooner.  Since I wrote to the Diocese
                    of Rochester, several people from the Diocese have told me that they were following the instructions in
                    the letter from Bishop Singh and the chair of the standing committee Cameron Miller to not contact me and
                    to respect my privacy! This was an orchestrated strategic isolation of a woman of color in a male dominated
                    institution. The impact of that sentence about “space” came as a shock to me when it was published. I needed
                    support, not silence. I was devastated that Rev. Cameron Miller’s attachment to that letter spoke for me
                    without even talking with me and took the liberty to use the term “impending divorce” which totally
                    misrepresented me and my desires. No legal paperwork had been filed at the time of this mailing. No one from
                    the standing committee talked with me. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another blow came when my sons and I were not even mentioned at the Bishop’s Farewell Party from the
                    Diocese of Rochester.  This oversight was acutely felt by our sons.  You will understand that a mother’s
                    pain for her slighted children is worse than she can possibly feel for herself. The Presiding Bishop
                    spoke at this event, lending his authority and stamp of approval to the event. This intentional act of
                    exclusion hurt because I loved this Diocese, and even more because I am a brown Dalit woman who has been
                    made invisible. I have become a nobody to the Church, except for a few kind laypeople who genuinely and
                    unconditionally reached out. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Most devastatingly, I did not hear a word from the Presiding Bishop after Bishop Singh’s letter, even
                    though my sons and I had enjoyed a close pastoral and friendly relationship with him. On December 17,
                    2022, I felt strong enough to email him to ask why.  He replied that he was given to  understand that
                    I did not wish to hear from him!  That is, he believed Bishop Singh so completely, so utterly, that our
                    years of pastoral care and friendship were immediately erased. He did speak with me once over zoom on
                    February 22nd, 2023, reiterating the fact that an individual not identified by Curry told him that I did
                    not want to be contacted by him. Further, Bishop Curry stated that he asked that individual to convey to
                    me that I could call him anytime. I informed Bishop Curry that I never stated that I did not want to be
                    in contact with him. I was never informed that I could call PB Curry any time. Another lie, omission, and
                    strategic isolation. In that call I clearly stated that I left the house because I did not feel safe. I
                    mentioned the excessive use of alcohol by Bishop Singh. Further,I offered my help to provide resources
                    for other Bishop and clergy families in similar abusive situations. The Presiding Bishop stated that Bishop
                    Todd Ousley will be in touch with me, but six months passed and still no word from the PB or from Ousley
                    or his office. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Presiding Bishop and other church leaders decided to ignore 31 years of physical, verbal, and
                    emotional abuse and lies that my sons and I disclosed.  Is this what Jeus would do? It is very sad
                    that a church community that is supposed to stand with the oppressed, instead joins hands with power,
                    patriarchy and privilege to silence the truth. This is irrefutably abuse impinged on a family on the
                    part of the Episcopal Church in its negligence, dismissive attitude and refusal to hear the truth about
                    domestic abuse and pushing the facts on abuse under the rug to protect a Bishop. This spiritual abuse
                    by the church has caused my children and me emotional and psychological trauma.    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I loved the church so much that I wanted to marry a priest. Our marriage was quasi- arranged by a close
                    family friend who was Bishop Singh’s aunt. We were introduced in August, 1991 and were married two months
                    later. I was  enamored by his charisma, kindness, the fact that he said he would not take a dowry, and
                    that he stated that did not care about caste. Whether he intentionally lied or deceived himself, after
                    28 years of marriage; I realized that he had lived our entire marriage viewing me as lesser because of
                    our caste differences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The emotional abuse started quite early in our life together. Before we were married, he told me that
                    he was in love with a person while in Seminary and that her father did not approve of their marriage.
                    In his video message on Facebook on June 20th 2023 about his remarriage he says, “we dated in seminary”
                    but it was more than that. When we were married, Singh told me--full of male entitlement--that I needed
                    to be patient with him until he got over his former lover. Barely two months into our marriage he told
                    me that he was attracted to fair-skinned women! I lost all confidence and joy in that moment. Days after
                    our first son was born, he wrote to his friend, David Singh, saying that I did not have a pretty face
                    and he was struggling to love me. There was no point in our marriage at which he stated that he had moved
                    on from his former lover and that I was the only love in his life now.  She was an invisible presence in
                    our marriage, and he tried to fill that invisibility with deep emotional attachments with other visible
                    women. Charming as he is, that was easy – women and girls with ready access to him swarmed, right from
                    the very early years of our marriage. If I brought it up, he would scream at me. He keeps stating now that
                    he was faithful to me; maybe he was physically but he was not emotionally. Even his act of stating the
                    lack of “infidelity” publicly and unpromoted makes it seem untrue.  In fact, in 2014 he emailed me a picture
                    from a Bishop’s conference in Taiwan. The picture was a selfie with a woman who looked like his ex-lover.
                    He expected me to accept it as a joke! This incident pulled me down.

                    We moved to the USA as a family with our baby, Nivedhan, in 1993. I was in the USA in 1990 doing my
                    masters in Christian Education in Virginia. I continued my studies and Bishop Singh joined a master’s
                    in theology Program. Rocky years emerged with the pattern of loving and caring followed by physical
                    and verbal abuse. He would throw  things, lift his hands in beating gestures, and even wave a knife
                    at me while with marriage counseling. His alcoholism grew worse year by year, so much so that I slowly
                    felt less desire for his company. As a family we would barely get 20 minutes of his non-alcohol self
                    each day.  It was hours and hours of drinking, watching TV and sleeping/passing out on the couch. He
                    continued to blame me for his alcohol use throughout our marriage counseling sessions because I brought
                    it up for discussion. In a June 6, 2020 email to me, Bishop Singh said, “Your psychological fragility
                    was a huge part of why I have done this work of absorbing your anxieties by just biting my tongue. And
                    my subsequent drinking.”

                    In our home, as my sons have already stated, we were subject to several forms of abuse. I was relieved
                    when our older son Nivedhan secured admission into the American Boychoir Boarding school from 6th grade
                    till 8th grade because he was subject to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Eklan was subject
                    to a lot of anger and derogatory words as well, especially in front of his friends. If I intervened at
                    any point, Bishop Singh yelled at me.  Humiliating me with racist, derogatory words in Tamil such as,
                    “Mayiru” (pubic hair). I experienced financial abuse as well. I would periodically find out that thousands
                    of dollars were given to his family/relatives, and institutions here without consulting me. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our son, Eklan, struggled with depression from the relentless emotional abuse. He was brave enough to
                    share this truth in his own open letter, which he shared with Presiding Bishop Curry on December 29, 2022.
                    Bishop Singh did not have any sympathy, but insisted that he snap out of it. When I expressed concern with
                    Bishop Singh’s lack of care and dismissiveness around his attention to other women, he would snigger and
                    mock me. He would reject me emotionally and physically at those times. This escalated behavior eventually
                    increased my anxiety level and during one of his trips to India in 2013, without even saying bye to me,
                    my therapist advised me to seek psychiatric care. Upon his return there was no sympathy. “I don’t want to
                    talk about this and ruin our reunion…Don’t expect that you will now be the center of my world” These words
                    pierced through me. He would often remind me that, “Being joyful is a choice!” This is emotionally
                    unintelligent, offensive, and stigmatizes the realities of mental health.

                    Eventually, the years of abuse and use of alcohol became too much to bear . On January 23, 2021--I left
                    our family home because I feared for my physical safety. Bishop Singh’s response shows that I was right
                    to be concerned. My sons and I have faced isolation, public slander, unethical disclosures of private
                    medical information, and personal heartbreak. The Church was my home since I was born and now I have lost
                    my home. My sons have lost their home. I have lost trust in the church, and its leaders.

                    To the priests and leaders in the Episcopal Church who stand for truth, please act on your belief.
                    You preach that God seeks out the vulnerable and rejects the people in power. I ask you to follow Christ’s
                    example and believe survivors of abuse when we share our stories. Aren’t we a part of “God’s beloved” as well?
