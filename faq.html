                  Many people know Prince Singh as a highly charismatic preacher and inspiring leader in the church.
                  Those much closer to him experience him as a practiced manipulator and a functioning alcoholic who
                  takes his anger out on his family, all while being repeatedly protected by and promoted in the Episcopal Church.
                  In detailed public letters, we have disclosed the physical and emotional abuse experienced by our mother,
                  Jebaroja Singh, and us at the hands of our father. That abuse includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Physical, drunken battery of Nivedhan on a regular basis</li>
                  <li>Once waving a kitchen knife at our mother while screaming at her</li>
                  <li>Throwing objects at us constantly</li>
                  <li>Screaming at us on a daily basis</li>
                  <li>Using his financial support and authority as bishop to silence and threaten us</li>
                </ul>

                  Why? We believe that our father’s role in the church and his upcoming remarriage puts him in a position to harm others.
                  We have yet to see] evidence of repentance indicating that he has dealt with the root issues and character flaws that generated decades of abuse.
                  Saying “I’m sorry” while only changing on the surface is not repentance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why now? Now that we are adults with experience in the world, we realize that the circumstances of our childhood were violent and unusual.
                  Unfortunately, children of abusive parents often have no choice but to normalize their experiences to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That normalization began to unravel for us when our parents divorced. People get divorced all the time, even priests and bishops,
                  but our parents’ divorce process—and especially the public perception of it through our father’s image-management narratives—became tainted
                  almost immediately by our father’s unchecked authority in the church. With the help of official church communication channels,
                  he was able to publish a face-saving, image-managing narrative about how the divorce came to pass, not only violating our privacy
                  but convincing others—including Presiding Bishop Curry—that we should be abandoned by the church in the name of “respecting our privacy.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we disclosed the domestic violence directly to Presiding Bishop Curry and detailed our father’s public facade towards us
                  and our mother regarding the divorce, the Presiding Bishop’s office responded with a substandard process that was not in keeping with
                  Title IV of the Canons of the Episcopal Church. Rather than recognizing that allegations of decades worth of alcohol fueled abuse and
                  untruthful statements rise to the level of Title IV offenses if they are true and launching an investigation, we were offered help
                  in a “therapeutic setting” with a non-licensed “counselor” who happened to be a (non-TEC) clergyperson and close personal friend of our father.
                  While this person claimed to have been appointed by the Presiding Bishop, we received no communication from the office of the Presiding Bishop,
                  Bishop Todd Ousley, other members of the Presiding Bishop’s staff making this assertion or offering us other options.
                  After one failed session, action halted other than one Zoom call between my mother and Presiding Bishop Curry in February 2023
                  in which she shared some of her concerns and offered recommendations for how to care for the families of Bishops in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After going public, six months of inaction was transformed into action in only six days. That’s why we came forward publicly now.

                  Yes; in a June 19, 2023, letter to the Episcopal Dioceses of Eastern and Western Michigan, our father announced that he had called for
                  a disciplinary investigation into himself, under the Episcopal Church’s Title IV procedures. However, anyone reading the letter should
                  be left with substantial doubt about the independence and validity of that investigation. The letter also demonstrates that our father
                  has not finished emotionally abusing us even as he claims to be seeking therapeutic help for his problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are several problems with this letter that we must highlight:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled pl-4">
                  <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>
                      Our father positions himself as a valid source of information about this process and its progress:
                      “I will continue to be in conversation with the Presiding Bishop and our diocesan leaders to keep
                      them apprised of this process and to check in along the way.”
                    </strong>
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    It is inappropriate for someone under investigation of domestic abuse to be responsible for providing updates to anyone about the
                    progress of that investigation. Our father is, in fact, the last person who should be in conversation with Presiding Bishop Curry,
                    diocesan leadership, and others about the process. That must be the charge of an independent investigator.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>
                      Our father minimizes our allegations as that of a “family conflict” related to
                      “the lack of privacy afforded to a family when one parent is a bishop.”
                    </strong>
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    Domestic abuse is not only a violation of ordination vows and the baptismal covenant, it is a crime and a sin.
                    We have not accused our father of being a bishop who struggled to parent us due to the circumstances of his job.
                    We have disclosed that he physically hit and verbally abused us throughout our childhoods.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>
                      Our father publicly discloses details related to our mental and physical health as a means of speaking for us:
                      “My older son was willing to do one therapy session before requesting to discontinue due to his tinnitus.
                      My younger son said he was not ready to do this work.”
                    </strong>
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    It is inappropriate for anyone to discuss the mental and physical health of their family members in a public venue without consent.
                    In this case, our father did so as a bishop communicating on a church platform as a means of defending himself against his victims.
                    We gave him no permission to disclose private details about our health to anyone, let alone a large public audience.
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-2">
                    <strong>
                      He describes our allegations as “serious” but then trivializes them by announcing his plans to take time off in response:
                      “The Presiding Bishop’s Office has not called for a suspension or restriction on ministry.
                      I will, however, take a week’s break to do the clinical evaluation, and will go on a reflective retreat during the week of July 4th.”
                    </strong>
                  </li>
                  <li class="mb-4">
                    It is unclear to us how a week in clinical evaluation and another week in “reflective retreat” is an appropriate response to allegations
                    of physical and emotional abuse. Presiding Bishop Curry’s lack of action should not be viewed by the church as an indication of our
                    father’s innocence so much as a symptom of institutional incompetence, but our father nonetheless uses this fact to shield himself from
                    what would have been appropriate: an immediate suspension of his ministry while an independent investigator works to determine if our
                    claims are factual. Even if our allegations were untrue—and they are true—the seriousness of them warrants suspension and investigation.

                  We are moving forward with the Title IV complaint process and encourage others to do so.
                  However, if the June 19 letter(ADD LINK HERE) is any indication, our trust should be limited.
                  This letter was awful for us. After publicly identifying ourselves as survivors of our father’s abuse,
                  the Dioceses of Eastern and Western Michigan’s leaders (and, most likely, lawyers) deemed it appropriate
                  to come out in full support of our abuser, lending diocesan resources to his response.
                  In our view, those leaders are now complicit in our abuse—what we experienced in the past, as well as the
                  retraumatization and further harm from the response of leadership to our disclosures of abuse and
                  the farcical process that compelled us to take public action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Likewise, Presiding Bishop Curry is also responsible for actively mishandling our abuse disclosures by
                  failing to follow the guidelines of the Title IV canons. Curry has known full well of our suffering for
                  months and has allowed our father undue oversight of the church’s response. Curry has upheld his full support
                  for my father’s recent promotion, increased salary, and his recent engagement to be remarried. Only now—after
                  the release of our letters, including the publication of a letter to Curry urging him to take action—has a
                  Title IV investigation of Prince Singh's abusive history actually been launched.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These facts are not the hallmarks of an institution that is prepared to run a thorough and independent
                  investigation of our claims. They suggest concern for optics and status rather than for survivors.
                  They confirm that this is image management, and not a legitimate investigative process.
                  So far, we have seen no evidence to the contrary. We see an institution refusing to treat an accused abuser as just that:
                  someone unworthy of trust until the truth has been clearly established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Read the letters closely, not as an Episcopalian but as someone scrutinizing a potential abuser.
                  You can see bold efforts to misdirect your attention around this remarriage. You can see manipulative attempts to
                  prey on your empathy, citing privacy and embarrassment. Even worse, consider the attempt to dismiss the courage it
                  took for us to finally speak out with reductive statements like “divorce is messy.” This is a blatant attempt to further
                  silence us, which in turn will silence other domestic abuse survivors. Those who speak out about abuse within the Episcopal
                  Church will face the narrative wrath of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are not bishops. We do not have a team of lawyers and the full support of a centuries-old institution—or an Episcopal
                  Church-funded MailChimp email platform to hit hundreds of thousands of inboxes with the press of a button.
                  But we still have a voice. The Episcopal Church has chosen the side of the abuser, but we still have a voice.
                  The appropriate time to call for a serious investigation into a bishop is when you learn from multiple adult
                  survivors that this bishop has a prolonged pattern of abuse—not six months later, after a compromised sham of a mediation process,
                  biased unlicensed “counseling,” and after details get posted on Facebook. This has caused us, as survivors,
                  to lose all trust with the church’s process and to see public calls for accountability as the only way forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We cannot trust the process. But we still have a voice.

                  You can start by considering our letters and, we hope, believing us. We seek to bring light to abuse
                  we experienced in the hopes that it will help others inside and outside of the church, and that the church
                  will take action to ensure our father cannot harm others while wearing a collar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can help by not giving in to a narrative that would paint us as petulant boys afraid of our father’s new
                  relationship and naïve to the nature of divorce—precisely what our father attempted to do in a video response
                  on June 16, 2023. We are adults of 30 and 22 years. We do not speak from naivety. We speak the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can help by joining in our call for accountability. We have both decided to make the difficult step of
                  seeking accountability as we now have enough distance from our father that we can safely hold him accountable
                  without destroying ourselves. We believe that he is unfit for his office and that the same character traits
                  that led him to abuse his power at home will also bring destruction in his capacity as bishop and to his new family.
                  The behavioral patterns he manifested consistently in our lives do not just go away with surface displays of
                  “going to therapy” or “saying sorry” that fail to address the roots of these pathological behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We openly ask Presiding Bishop Curry: What level of alcohol-fueled domestic abuse is acceptable in the House of Bishops?
                  Precisely how much hitting and screaming by a Bishop does it take to prompt an investigation instead of a therapeutic
                  process led by an abuser’s friend? And are clergy families of color not entitled to a bare minimum of institutional
                  accountability because we are held to lower moral standards?
                </p>
                <p>
                  And we ask the same of you. Is this acceptable in your church?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is our mission to call for Provisional Bishop Prince Singh and Presiding Bishop Michael Curry to resign for this gross
                  negligence and victim blaming, and to protect current and future domestic violence survivors from forced silencing and
                  retraumatization by the Episcopal Church. Our case has been mishandled. It’s time for that to change, and for justice to emerge.
