        If you are an Episcopalian who stands with us, we humbly ask you to stop financially
        donating to The Episcopal Church, until the organization has clearly demonstrated it will
        not silence abuse survivors and will repent from its own evident, public mistakes.
        If you are asked why, we hope you will share our story.
        If you have something you would like to share with TEC leadership, relevant contact information
        can be found below. We encourage you to share your thoughts and feelings, as well as the impact TEC's
        inaction in this matter has on you and your support of TEC. We encourage you to share with TEC leadership,
        as well as your local Clergy. We have included email templates below for your convinience.

        <p id="episcopalian-email" class="template">Dear _______,

When survivors of domestic abuse disclose, there is an expectation of prompt action and due diligence on the part of the Office of the Presiding Bishop and the Office of Pastoral Development, as per the Title IV Canons of The Episcopal Church. To wait 6 months for survivors to go public on social media before launching an official investigation proves that TEC is more concerned with their public image, than with adhering to the teachings of Christ. 

I have been a member of _____ parish for ___ years. I typically give approximately $ ____ per year to institutions associated with The Episcopal Church. I stand with #EpiscopalSurvivors and, for this reason, I will no longer be supporting TEC financially until Bishop Prince Singh is defrocked. I would also like to formally launch a Title IV investigation into Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, and Bishop Todd Ousley for their calculated mishandling of Roja, Nivedhan, and Eklan Singh’s disclosure of Bishop Prince Singh’s history of domestic violence and alcoholism. A legitimate investigation at this level of national TEC Staff should be overseen by a 3rd party investigatory body. 

Sincerely,

________</p>

I stand with #EpiscopalSurvivors and, for this reason, I will continue to share the story of this gross abuse of power in my professional and personal circles until Bishop Prince Singh is defrocked.
