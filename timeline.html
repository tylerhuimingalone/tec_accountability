                  <p>
                    "My father would administer an <i>Adi</i> on me regularly. <i>Adi</i> is the Tamil word for ‘beating.’
                    I received an <i>Adi</i> as punitive physical abuse. When my father had been drinking or was hungover,
                    this would escalate to prolonged, hard hits across my thighs, arms, legs, and face. Reasons for the
                    physical abuse included:
                    <ul>
                      <li>being late for school</li>
                      <li>getting something wrong on homework</li>
                      <li>getting bad grades</li>
                      <li>misbehaving in church</li>
                      <li>misbehaving in front of guests</li>
                      <li>saying a bad word</li>
                      <li>speaking ill of somone else</li>
                      <li>asking for an expensive toy at the store</li>
                    </ul>
                    "The threatening question, <i>Adi ventuma?!</i> was yelled at me frequently. The English translation
                    is, "Do you want a beating?!" This was more than spanking. I remember the intensity of my sobbing
                    during the abuse. I found it hard to breathe, and remember gasping for air while being struck.
                    After the abuse, I would be sent to my room where I would cry myself to sleep. Sometimes I would
                    urinate on my own carpet in silent protest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My father grew up in a physically abusive household. I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things
                    at my grandmother, bruising her. My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                    Instead of breaking the cycle of abuse, my father went on to abuse his own children. My father hit me often as a form of punishment
                    growing up. He threw things at us. I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video
                    game systems ripped apart. Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day before
                    school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time;
                    so he could not use his hands. I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often. When my dad tried to spank my baby brother
                    for the first time, I got between them and said, 'No, not him.' I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my
                    father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a 'difficult kid'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While my father was an Associate Priest at St. Peters Episcopal Church in Morristown, NJ, I tied a lamp cord around
                    my neck and pulled it as hard as I could in a suicidal attempt to escape the beatings. I was 10 years old at the
                    time. Nighttime bedwetting became an uncontrollable problem for me and would continue until I was around 13 years
                    old, when I was able to live away from the abuse at boarding school. I have teachers and friends who can verify
                    I wore diapers at night until 7th grade. I have been in trauma recovery therapy, including EMDR sessions about
                    the physical abuse since 2018, and I can provide receipts from my health insurance to verify this."

              Bp Singh sends an email to the Episcopal Diocese of Rochester with a false, image-managing
              narrative about his divorce, claiming that it was amicable &
              not due to abuse. The claim that the family requests “privacy” results in
              the isolation of Roja & their sons from church community. "Conduct involving
              dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation" is a violation of TEC's Canon 4: Of

                    Bishop Singh states that he will have to resign due to the allegations.
                    He characterizes the abuse as “spanking" & voices dismay that apologizing
                    is not treated as sufficient to repair the relationship. Predatory behavior
                    is in violation of TEC's General Convention Resolution 2018-D091.

              Nivedhan expresses concerns about David Singh's qualifications on the phone with Bp Singh,
              as David Singh is not a licensed therapist. Nivedhan states that he would feel better
              with an unbiased 3rd party, but Bp Singh pushes back, saying that he is having trouble
              finding someone who will counsel across state lines/virtually.

              Todd Ousley never follows up, and does not launch a Title IV investigation.

                <div class="pt-2 pb-2">
                  <p>
                    Presiding Bishop Curry says Todd Ousley will follow up directly with pastoral care. He uses the phrase,
                    "Family therapy" in his note to Roja. Family therapy implies an unbiased, 3rd party. Counseling is
                    something within the scope of a pastor to provide, with the proper licensure. While David Singh may
                    be a counselor, his close history with Bishop Singh makes this unethical. Nivedhan raised all of these
                    concerns to Bishop Singh on a phone call on February 22nd, 2023 - So, we cannot say for certain what
                    Presiding Bishop Curry knew or did not know about David Singh's qualifications/involvement. What we do
                    know is that Presiding Bishop Curry and Todd Ousley did not follow up with Roja or her sons, or launch
                    a Title IV investigation into their claims. This left them vulnerable to Bishop Singh's influence and
                    undue control over the situation.
                    According to Title IV, Canon 6, Section 3, "Any person other than the Intake Officer who receives
                    information regarding an Offense shall <i>promptly</i> forward the information to the Intake Officer."
                    Failing to do so is a violation of Title

              Bishop Singh uses church platform to dismiss allegations as internal family conflict about
              his new marriage. In public TEC message, he clearly states "The divorce from two and a half
              years ago has been a painful transition and this pain has developed further as I moved into a
              new relationship". "Conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation"
              is a violation of TEC's TEC's Canon 4: Of Standards of Conduct, Sec. 1.h.6.

                <h5 class="title">Bishop Singh and Episcopal Diocese of Eastern & Western Michigan dismiss public abuse disclosures as "internal family dynamics" in The Episcopal Church public announcement</h5>
                <div class="pt-2 pb-2">
                  <p>
                    Episcopal Dioceses of Eastern & Western Michigan allow Bishop Singh to respond directly
                    to public allegations. Bishop Singh has physically and emotionally abused his family for
                    28 years. Bishop Singh dismisses allegations using phrases like, "Divorce is messy and
                    mine was no exception." Bp Singh publicly lies again that the divorce was amicable. The
                    Episcopal Church states that Bishop Singh has launched a Title IV investigation into
                    himself. Other Bishops/clergy have likely already reported to proper Title IV channels.
                    Bishop Singh cites a "therapeutic setting", ignoring David Singh's bias and lack of
                    qualifications. Legitimate therapy requires a licensed, unbiased 3rd party.

                  <p>
                    In the ongoing Title IV investigation involving Prince Singh, significant progress has been reported.
                    The Episcopal Church's Reference Panel has met on multiple occasions (September 25, October 18, and
                    November 3, 2023) to discuss the complaints specifically concerning the Singhs. Although an attempt was
                    made to reach an accord with the Presiding Bishop-Designate regarding disciplinary actions, an agreement
                    has not been reached at this stage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Subsequently, on November 3, the matter was officially referred for a comprehensive investigation, as stipulated
                    under Canon IV.6.8 and Canon IV.2. The Presiding Bishop-Designate has taken steps to appoint an Investigator to
                    thoroughly examine the allegations presented by the Singhs. This investigation is being conducted independently of
                    other Title IV complaints related to Bishop Singh’s ministry in the Diocese of Rochester.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The process of investigation is expected to be meticulous and time-consuming. Consequently, the Reference Panel does
                    not anticipate having the Investigator’s final report ready for their next scheduled meeting on November 20, 2023.
                    However, in compliance with Canon IV.6.9, periodic written status reports will be provided to keep the complainants
                    informed of any developments. This approach ensures transparency and continued communication throughout the
                    investigation process.

                    <span>How Long Does Title IV Take?</span>
                    <p>
                      The Episcopal Church's Title IV process, which governs the ecclesiastical discipline of clergy,
                      is a multi-stage process that can be lengthy and complex. Here's a summary of the different stages,
                      with an emphasis on the potential duration of each phase:

                        <span class="inline">
                          The process begins with the submission of a written complaint to the Intake Officer,
                          who conducts an initial review to determine if the allegations, if true, would constitute an offense under Title IV.
                          This stage typically takes a few weeks to a month, depending on the complexity of the complaint
                          and the availability of the Intake Officer.

                          If the Intake Officer decides to move forward, the complaint is referred to a Reference Panel,
                          which includes the bishop diocesan, an intake officer, and the president of the Disciplinary Board.
                          The panel decides whether to dismiss the complaint, resolve it pastorally, or refer it for further investigation.
                          This stage can take several weeks to a couple of months.

              This letter requests an independent investigation into the Office of the Presiding Bishop and the
              Office of Pastoral Development of The Episcopal Church, alleging failures by the Most Rev. Michael Curry
              and the Rt. Rev. Todd Ousley to promptly initiate Title IV proceedings in response to the Singh family's

                  <p>
                    This letter, written by Dr. Jebaroja Singh, Nivedhan Singh, Eklan Singh, and the volunteers of Episcopal Accountability,
                    requests an independent, third-party investigation into the Office of the Presiding Bishop and the Office of Pastoral Development
                    (OPD) of The Episcopal Church. The letter alleges that the Most Rev. Michael Curry, Presiding Bishop, and the Rt. Rev. Todd Ousley,
                    Director of OPD, failed to promptly initiate Title IV proceedings in response to the Singh family's December 2022 disclosures of
                    domestic violence, alcoholism, verbal and emotional abuse, and lying committed by the Rt. Rev. Prince Singh.
                    The letter argues that no bishop or priest of the Episcopal Church is sufficiently free of conflict of interest to carry out an
                    investigation into these offices, necessitating an independent inquiry to achieve the goals of Title IV.
                    The letter provides a detailed account of the Singh family's interactions with church leadership, their disclosures of abuse,
                    and the alleged failures of Bishops Curry and Ousley to adhere to Title IV requirements. The letter concludes by emphasizing the
                    need for an independent investigation to restore trust in the Title IV process and ensure accountability within the church.

            <p class="description">
              The Episcopal Church announces new measures to increase transparency in disciplinary matters involving bishops.
              These measures include creating easily accessible paths on the church's website for reporting misconduct,
              viewing the status of current disciplinary matters involving bishops, and publishing an annual statistical
              report on complaints against bishops and their outcomes.

                  <p>
                    The Episcopal Church announces new measures to increase transparency in disciplinary matters involving bishops.
                    These measures include creating easily accessible paths on the church's website for reporting misconduct,
                    viewing the status of current disciplinary matters involving bishops, and publishing an annual statistical
                    report on complaints against bishops and their outcomes. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry has decided to make
                    information public in these matters when he deems it pastorally appropriate. The goal is to strike a balance
                    between transparency and privacy, aiming for healing, repentance, forgiveness, restitution, justice, amendment of life,
                    and reconciliation among all involved or affected. The procedural progress of Title IV matters involving bishops will
                    be disclosed in certain public situations, such as when a bishop's ministry is restricted or they are placed on administrative leave.
                    Information on current and past cases, as well as resources to understand the Title IV process,
                    are now available on the church's website.
