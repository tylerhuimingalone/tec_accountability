                    Bishop Singh would administer what he called an "Ati" on Nivedhan Singh regularly.
                    "Ati" is the Tamil word for "beating". Nivedhan Singh recieved an "Ati" as punitive physical abuse.
                    Other times, when Bishop Singh had been drinking - it would escalate to prolonged,
                    hard hits across Nivedhan's thighs, arms, legs, and face.
                    Reasons for the physical abuse included:
                    <ul class="ml-3">
                      <li>Being late for school</li>
                      <li>Getting something wrong on homework</li>
                      <li>Getting bad grades</li>
                      <li>Misbehaving in church</li>
                      <li>Misbehaving in front of guests</li>
                      <li>Saying a bad word</li>
                      <li>Speaking ill of somone else</li>
                      <li>Asking for an expensive toy at the store</li>
                    </ul>
                    The threatening question, "Ati ventuma?!" was yelled at Nivedhan Singh often by Bishop Singh.
                    The English translation is, "Do you want a spank?!".
                    Nivedhan Singh remembers the intensity of his own sobbing during the abuse.
                    He found it hard to breath during the abuse, due to the intensity of these physically and emotionally abusive esperiences
                    and remembers gasping for air while being struck.
                    After the abuse, he would be sent to his room where he would cry himself to sleep.
                    Sometime Nivedhan Singh would urinate on his own carpet in silent protest of the abuse.
                    Nighttime bed wetting became an uncontrolable problem for Nivedhan Singh and would continue until he was 12 years old.

                    My father grew up in a physically abusive household.
                    I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things at my grandmother, bruising her.
                    My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                    As many know, victims of abuse often become perpetrators themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My father hit me often as a form of punishment growing up. He threw things at us.
                    I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video game systems ripped apart.
                    Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively.
                    I remember one day before school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain
                    because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time; so he could not use his hands.
                    I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often.
                    When my dad tried to spank my baby brother for the first time, I got between them and said,
                    "No, not him." I would not see the cycle of abuse continue.
                    When I asked my father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a "difficult kid."

              Bishop Singh grabbed the system, and ripped it from the TV - causing the system to break in front of Nivedhan Singh.

                  <p>
                    My father grew up in a physically abusive household.
                    I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things at my grandmother, bruising her.
                    My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                    As many know, victims of abuse often become perpetrators themselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My father hit me often as a form of punishment growing up. He threw things at us.
                    I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video game systems ripped apart.
                    Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively.
                    I remember one day before school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain
                    because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time; so he could not use his hands.
                    I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often.
                    When my dad tried to spank my baby brother for the first time, I got between them and said,
                    "No, not him." I would not see the cycle of abuse continue.
                    When I asked my father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a "difficult kid."
