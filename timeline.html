                  <p>
                    "My father would administer an <i>Adi</i> on me regularly. <i>Adi</i> is the Tamil word for ‘beating.’
                    I received an <i>Adi</i> as punitive physical abuse. When my father had been drinking or was hungover,
                    this would escalate to prolonged, hard hits across my thighs, arms, legs, and face. Reasons for the
                    physical abuse included:
                    <ul>
                      <li>being late for school</li>
                      <li>getting something wrong on homework</li>
                      <li>getting bad grades</li>
                      <li>misbehaving in church</li>
                      <li>misbehaving in front of guests</li>
                      <li>saying a bad word</li>
                      <li>speaking ill of somone else</li>
                      <li>asking for an expensive toy at the store</li>
                    </ul>
                    "The threatening question, <i>Adi ventuma?!</i> was yelled at me frequently. The English translation
                    is, "Do you want a beating?!" This was more than spanking. I remember the intensity of my sobbing
                    during the abuse. I found it hard to breathe, and remember gasping for air while being struck.
                    After the abuse, I would be sent to my room where I would cry myself to sleep. Sometimes I would
                    urinate on my own carpet in silent protest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "My father grew up in a physically abusive household. I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things
                    at my grandmother, bruising her. My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                    Instead of breaking the cycle of abuse, my father went on to abuse his own children. My father hit me often as a form of punishment
                    growing up. He threw things at us. I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video
                    game systems ripped apart. Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day before
                    school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time;
                    so he could not use his hands. I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often. When my dad tried to spank my baby brother
                    for the first time, I got between them and said, 'No, not him.' I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my
                    father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a 'difficult kid'.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    "While my father was an Associate Priest at St. Peters Episcopal Church in Morristown, NJ, I tied a lamp cord around
                    my neck and pulled it as hard as I could in a suicidal attempt to escape the beatings. I was 10 years old at the
                    time. Nighttime bedwetting became an uncontrollable problem for me and would continue until I was around 13 years
                    old, when I was able to live away from the abuse at boarding school. I have teachers and friends who can verify
                    I wore diapers at night until 7th grade. I have been in trauma recovery therapy, including EMDR sessions about
                    the physical abuse since 2018, and I can provide receipts from my health insurance to verify this."

                    Nivedhan writes a letter that discloses his father's domestic abuse and alcoholism to Presiding Bishop Michael Curry.
                    He was scared for his father and unsure about how to proceed. Nivedhan Singh trusted that perhaps Michael Curry would
                    know what to do in terms of holding Bishop Singh accountable, and providing a path toward healing and fixing
                    things with his dad. Nivedhan Singh was not made aware of Title IV at the time of his disclosure, nor was it something
                    ever explained to Bishop Singh's family.

                  <p>
                    Presiding Bishop Curry says Todd Ousley will follow up directly with pastoral care. He uses the phrase,
                    "Family therapy" in his note to Roja. Family therapy implies an unbiased, 3rd party. Counseling is something
                    within the scope of a pastor to provide, with the proper licensure. While David Singh may be a counselor,
                    his close history with Bishop Singh makes this unethical. Nivedhan raised all of these concerns to Bishop Singh
                    on a phone call on February 22nd, 2023 - So, we cannot say for certain what Presiding Bishop Curry knew or
                    did not know about David Singh's qualifications/involvement. What we do know is that Presiding Bishop Curry
                    and Todd Ousley did not follow up with Roja or her sons and left them vulnerable to Bishop Singh's influence
                    and undue control over the situation.

                    Episcopal Dioceses of Eastern & Western Michigan allow Bishop Singh to respond directly to public allegations.
                    Bishop Singh dismisses allegations using phrases like, "Divorce is messy and mine was no exception."
                    The Episcopal Church states that Bishop Singh has launched a Title IV investigation into himself.
                    Other Bishops/clergy have likely already reported to proper Title IV channels.
                    Bishop Singh cites Zoom meeting with David Singh as a "therapeutic setting", ignoring David Singh's bias and lack of qualifications.

                  <p>
                    Bishop Singh has blocked ex-wife and sons on all platforms, email, and phone. So, there is no "we" working through this.

                    I continue to maintain that these allegations are untrue but are a sign of deep hurt within my family.
