                We, the sons of Episcopal Church Bishop Prince Singh, seek the resignation
                and defrocking of our father from his role as Provisional Bishop of the Dioceses
                of Eastern and Western Michigan after 28 years of physical and emotional abuse
                of us and our mother; and we seek to launch a Title IV investigation of Presiding
                Bishop Michael Curry and Bishop Todd Ousley for mishandling our serious allegations
                of abuse and, rather, allowing our father to control the process that would
                supposedly bring us healing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We communicated our experiences of domestic violence to Presiding Bishop Curry on
                December 29, 2022, and felt that it was his responsibility to identify our
                experience as a Title IV offence, warranting an investigation and disciplinary process.
                Instead, we were met with negligence, misdirection, and an unethical process filled
                with conflicts of interest. With the help of Presiding Bishop Curry and our father’s
                friends and colleagues, the power structures and public relations instruments of the
                Episcopal Church were used to cover up and minimize the nature of our abuse.
                As Indian Americans, we are a minority family in the Episcopal Church. Given that our
                mother is a woman of color, and we are men of color, we see gross evidence of
                patriarchal and racial biases at play here. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In the wake of an unethical therapeutic process launched by Presiding Bishop Curry
                and rigged by our own father, and given our father’s increasing authority in the church
                and changes in his own family situation, we felt we had no choice but to go public with
                our experience to protect others and seek justice and healing for ourselves. Following a
                confusing, unprofessional, and damaging letter from our father to the dioceses he
                provisionally serves as bishop—published on the official channels of those dioceses on
                June 19, 2023—we made the decision to expand our accountability efforts.
              </p>
              <p>
                After reading our story, we hope you’ll stand with us. And if you have survived abuse
                from a clergy or bishop family member, we hope to provide reporting resources
                and help you realize that you are not alone.

                Bishop Singh would administer what he called an "Ati" on Nivedhan Singh regularly.
                "Ati" is the Tamil word for "beating". Nivedhan Singh recieved an "Ati" as punitive physical abuse.
                Other times, when Bishop Singh had been drinking - it would escalate to prolonged, hard hits across
                Nivedhan's thighs, arms, legs, and face. Reasons for the physical abuse included:
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>being late for school</li>
                <li>getting something wrong on homework</li>
                <li>getting bad grades</li>
                <li>misbehaving in church</li>
                <li>misbehaving in front of guests</li>
                <li>saying a bad word</li>
                <li>speaking ill of somone else</li>
                <li>asking for an expensive toy at the store</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The threatening question, "Ati ventuma?!" was yelled at Nivedhan Singh often by Bishop Singh.
                The english translation is, "Do you want a spank?!". Nivedhan Singh remembers the intensity of
                his own sobbing during the abuse. He found it hard to breath during the abuse, due to the intensity
                of these physically and emotionally abusive esperience and remembers gasping for air while being struck.
                After the abuse, he would be sent to his room where he would cry himself to sleep.
                Sometime Nivedhan Singh would urinate on his own carpet in silent protest of the abuse.
                Nighttime bed wetting became an uncontrolable problem for Nivedhan Singh and would continue until he was 12 years old.

                My father grew up in a physically abusive household. I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things
                at my grandmother, bruising her. My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                As many know, victims of abuse often become perpetrators themselves. My father hit me often as a form of punishment
                growing up. He threw things at us. I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video
                game systems ripped apart. Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day before
                school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time;
                so he could not use his hands. I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often. When my dad tried to spank my baby brother
                for the first time, I got between them and said, "No, not him." I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my
                father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a "difficult kid".
