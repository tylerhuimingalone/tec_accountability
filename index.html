                We, the sons of Episcopal Church Bishop Prince Singh, seek the resignation
                and defrocking of our father from his role as Provisional Bishop of the Dioceses
                of Eastern and Western Michigan after 28 years of physical and emotional abuse
                of us and our mother; and we seek to launch a Title IV investigation of Presiding
                Bishop Michael Curry and Bishop Todd Ousley for mishandling our serious allegations
                of abuse and, rather, allowing our father to control the process that would
                supposedly bring us healing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We communicated our experiences of domestic violence to Presiding Bishop Curry on
                December 29, 2022, and felt that it was his responsibility to identify our
                experience as a Title IV offense, warranting an investigation and disciplinary process.
                Instead, we were met with negligence, misdirection, and an unethical process filled
                with conflicts of interest. With the help of Presiding Bishop Curry and our father’s
                friends and colleagues, the power structures and public relations instruments of the
                Episcopal Church were used to cover up and minimize the nature of our abuse.
                As Indian Americans, we are a minority family in the Episcopal Church. Given that our
                mother is a woman of color, and we are men of color, we see gross evidence of
                patriarchal and racial biases at play here. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In the wake of an unethical therapeutic process launched by Presiding Bishop Curry
                and rigged by our own father, and given our father’s increasing authority in the church
                and changes in his own family situation, we felt we had no choice but to go public with
                our experience to protect others and seek justice and healing for ourselves. Following a
                confusing, unprofessional, and damaging letter from our father to the dioceses he
                provisionally serves as bishop—published on the official channels of those dioceses on
                June 19, 2023—we made the decision to expand our accountability efforts.

                After reading our story, we hope you’ll stand with us. And if you have survived abuse
                from a clergy or bishop family member, we hope to provide reporting resources and help

                I received an <i>Adi</i> as punitive physical abuse. When my father had been drinking or was hungover,
                this would escalate to prolonged, hard hits across my thighs, arms, legs, and face. Reasons for the
                physical abuse included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>being late for school</li>

              <p>
                "The threatening question, <i>Adi ventuma?!</i> was yelled at me frequently. The English translation
                is, "Do you want a beating?!" This was more than spanking. I remember the intensity of my sobbing
                during the abuse. I found it hard to breathe, and remember gasping for air while being struck.
                After the abuse, I would be sent to my room where I would cry myself to sleep. Sometimes I would
                urinate on my own carpet in silent protest.

                "My father grew up in a physically abusive household. I heard stories of how my grandfather would throw things
                at my grandmother, bruising her. My father, at the age of 11, would get between the two of them to stop the fighting.
                Instead of breaking the cycle of abuse, my father went on to abuse his own children. My father hit me often as a form of punishment
                growing up. He threw things at us. I had cell phones smashed in front of me, glass chess boards shattered, and video
                game systems ripped apart. Most of the physical violence was directed toward me punitively. I remember one day before
                school when he kicked me while I was on the ground screaming in pain because he was holding my crying baby brother at the time;
                so he could not use his hands. I was screamed at often. My mother was yelled at often. When my dad tried to spank my baby brother
                for the first time, I got between them and said, 'No, not him.' I would not see the cycle of abuse continue. When I asked my
                father (as an adult) why he used physical abuse as a form of punishment, his explanation was that I was a 'difficult kid'.
              </p>
              <p>
                "While my father was an Associate Priest at St. Peters Episcopal Church in Morristown, NJ, I tied a lamp cord around
                my neck and pulled it as hard as I could in a suicidal attempt to escape the beatings. I was 10 years old at the
                time. Nighttime bedwetting became an uncontrollable problem for me and would continue until I was around 13 years
                old, when I was able to live away from the abuse at boarding school. I have teachers and friends who can verify
                I wore diapers at night until 7th grade. I have been in trauma recovery therapy, including EMDR sessions about
                the physical abuse since 2018, and I can provide receipts from my health insurance to verify this."
